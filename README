Howdy,

This depends on python 3+ and needs the following pip3 modules:

flask
requests
beautifulsoup4
selenium (optional but it will improve extraction where there is no predefined plugin)

non-python packages:
phantomjs (optional but it will improve extraction where there is no predefined plugin) it can be found in some linux dist repos or compiled from source here:
http://phantomjs.org/download.html
